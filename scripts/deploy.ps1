## Deployment Steps Completed

- âœ… Dependencies checked
- âœ… Environment verified
- âœ… Tests passed
- âœ… Application built
- âœ… Performance tests run
- âœ… Firebase hosting deployed
- âœ… Firestore rules deployed
- âœ… Storage rules deployed

## URLs

- **Production:** https://your-project-id.web.app
- **Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-id

## Next Steps

1. Verify the application is working correctly
2. Monitor error rates in Sentry
3. Check performance metrics
4. Update DNS if using custom domain
